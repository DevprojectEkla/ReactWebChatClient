# React Client Application with WebRTC, WebSocket and Node.js Backend Integration

This React application serves as the client for my Node.js backend server [NodeReactPlatform](https://github.com/DevprojectEkla/NodeReactPlatform). It is designed to facilitate WebRTC for video streaming and utilizes WebSocket (via Socket.io) for real-time communication. The application provides a chat room where users can exchange basic text messages and turn on their webcams for video conferencing. Although some features, like the forum, are still under development, the core functionalities are in place.

The application can be served by the Node.js backend server or run independently using the `npm start` command provided by Create React App.

## Key Features
- **WebRTC for Video Streaming**: Implements WebRTC for peer-to-peer video streaming, enabling real-time video communication.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Uses Socket.io for WebSocket communication, allowing real-time, bidirectional interactions with the Node.js backend server.
- **Chat Room**: Provides a chat room where users can exchange basic text messages in real-time.
- **Video Conferencing**: Allows users to turn on their webcams for video conferencing, enhancing real-time communication.
- **Node.js Backend Server**: Communicates with the Node.js backend server for data management, business logic, and signaling for WebRTC.
- **Create React App**: Built using Create React App, allowing it to be easily run with `npm start` for development purposes.
- **Under Development**: Certain features, such as the forum, are still being built and are not fully functional yet.

## Running the Application
The application can be run in two ways:
1. **Served by Node.js Backend**: The Node.js backend server can serve the React application, providing a unified deployment and serving environment.
2. **Development Mode**: Use the `npm start` command to run the application in development mode, leveraging Create React App's development server.

To run the application in development mode:
```bash
npm start
